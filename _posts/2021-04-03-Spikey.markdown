Spikey is a malleable, [ndarray based](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.ndarray.html) spiking neural network framework and training platform.
Its SNN framework is built to be modified to fit a wide range of user's needs with many existing fully parameterized parts.
The training platform is inherently parrelelizable and supports custom training loops.
Various meta analysis tools, like a genetic algorithm, are provided to help users quickly solve for hyper-parameters in arbitrary experiments.
Spikey is regularly tested with python 3.7-3.9 in Linux and Windows, though it is a new project so expect to post bugs or suggestions in the issues tab.
